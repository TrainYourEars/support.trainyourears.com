Yes, buying it as a gift is possible. You just have to use this link to add the "GIFT" product to the cart: https://www.trainyourears.com/add-gift-to-cart. Then continue with the checkout process as normal.

Once you have finished the purchase, you will receive a confirmation email with instructions to send us the information of the person who will receive the license.

We need to know:

- Name (both name and surname)
- Email
- Country
- Date preference (optional)
- Personal message (optional)

Finally, we will prepare the license and we will send this person an email containing the download links, the license key, instructions about how to activate the software and your personal message.

If the date is not important, we will send it as soon as you answer :)

If you have any question or problem with this process let us know and we will help you out.
