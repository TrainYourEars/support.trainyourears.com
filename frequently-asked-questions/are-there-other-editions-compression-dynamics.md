# Are there other editions \(compression, dynamics\)?

We are working on the design of a new edition, which could be used to train anything, not only EQ or Compression. Something like a "Universal Audio Trainer". We want users to be able to create exercises for their own tools or needs. For example, an exercise to train different settings of their own VST Reverb plugin. Or an exercise to distinguish out-of-tune voices in a choir. We know it's a huge challenge and we are not even sure we can accomplish it. But we are going to try :\)
